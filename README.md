Progress Summary: Mine Identification Algorithm

Introduction: The project aims to develop an algorithm to identify mines within a 5x5 matrix of tiles extracted from larger images. The algorithm uses image processing techniques to compare tiles against reference images of mines, storing mine positions in a CSV file.

Key Milestones:

1.  Initial Algorithm Development: Developed a Python script using the Pillow library to extract tiles and compare them against reference mine images.

2.  Threshold Adjustment: Adjusted correlation threshold to 0.8 for improved accuracy in mine identification.

3.  Multiple Image Comparison: Updated the script to accept multiple reference images for enhanced detection accuracy.

4.  CSV Data Organization: Modified CSV output to group mine coordinates under respective image names for better organization and analysis.

Next Steps: Identify an algorithm to process the data about the mines and predict the upcoming location of the mines on providing a few dummy outcomes at first.
