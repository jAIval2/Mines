Progress Summary: Mine Identification Algorithm

Introduction: The project aims to develop an algorithm to identify mines within a 5x5 matrix of tiles extracted from larger images. The algorithm uses image processing techniques to compare tiles against reference images of mines, storing mine positions in a CSV file.

Key Milestones:

1.  Initial Algorithm Development: Developed a Python script using Pillow library to extract tiles and compare against reference mine images.

2.  Threshold Adjustment: Adjusted correlation threshold to 0.8 for improved accuracy in mine identification.

3.  Multiple Image Comparison: Updated the script to accept multiple reference images for enhanced detection accuracy.

4.  CSV Data Organization: Modified CSV output to group mine coordinates under respective image names for better organization and analysis.

Next Steps: Further enhancements may include optimizing threshold values for different scenarios and exploring advanced image processing techniques for improved mine detection accuracy. Additionally, refining the algorithm's efficiency for processing larger datasets can enhance its scalability and usability.
